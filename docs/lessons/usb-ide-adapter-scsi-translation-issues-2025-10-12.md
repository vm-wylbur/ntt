## 1. Problem Summary

The **Sabrent USB-DS12** IDE/SATA adapter (USB VID:PID `1f75:0611`, Innostor IS611 chipset) exhibits **broken SCSI-to-ATA translation firmware**.
These translation bugs manifest whenever the host issues modern SCSI commands such as `READ(16)` or `ATA PASS-THROUGH (16)`.

### Primary Symptoms

- `INQUIRY result too short (5), using 36` in dmesg
- Repeated `Invalid field in CDB` and `Medium not present` errors
- USB disconnects and re-enumeration loops
- `smartctl` / `hdparm -I` failures (`unsupported scsi opcode`)
- `ddrescue --idirect` hangs or leaves device in D-state
- ddrescue probing triggers USB resets within minutes
- Multiple USB device resets followed by disconnect
- "Media removed, stopped polling" even though disk is connected

### Root Cause (Firmware Analysis)

The IS611's internal SAT (SCSI-to-ATA Translation) implementation:
- Mis-encodes 16-byte CDBs for `READ(16)` and `WRITE(16)`
- Corrupts or truncates sense-data responses to `REQUEST SENSE`
- Rejects ATA PASS-THROUGH opcodes (0xA1/0x85) entirely
- Occasionally reports unsupported LBA48 addresses as illegal fields

As a result, the Linux `usb-storage` driver receives malformed sense data, interprets it as media removal, and resets the device — producing the cascading failures observed.

The adapter works initially with simple, sequential read/write operations but fails on:
- READ(16) commands to specific sectors
- Direct I/O operations
- SMART/ATA passthrough commands
- Aggressive disk probing by system services

---

## 2. Sustained Operation Failure

**Critical Finding:** The IS611 exhibits a **time-based firmware failure** after approximately **12 minutes** of sustained operation, regardless of disk or data.

### Evidence

- Multiple different physical disks fail at the same point
- Multiple different disk controllers fail at the same point
- Consistent failure after ~12 minutes of operation:
  - First attempt: 751 seconds → 42GB transferred
  - Second attempt: 739 seconds → 41GB transferred
  - Failure at sectors 81,080,320 - 82,720,768 (~41-42GB mark)

### Failure Sequence

1. USB resets begin (after ~12 minutes)
2. `DID_TIME_OUT` errors appear
3. Device goes offline
4. Multiple read attempts fail
5. Eventually USB disconnect

This is **NOT bad sectors** (different disks wouldn't fail at the same location). This is a **firmware resource exhaustion or time-based bug** in the IS611 chip that prevents sustained operation needed for full disk imaging.

---

## 3. Limitations for Vintage ATAPI / ZIP Drives

The same translation layer also fails with **ATAPI (packet) devices** such as IDE ZIP and optical drives:

| Operation | Expected | IS611 Behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `READ(10)` / `WRITE(10)` | Works | Usually OK |
| `READ(16)` / `WRITE(16)` | Not supported | Reports "Invalid field in CDB" |
| ATAPI PACKET commands | Supported | Often rejected |
| SMART / IDENTIFY | N/A | Triggers firmware bug |
| ddrescue probing | Sequential reads OK | Hangs on geometry queries |

Because the bridge mishandles ATAPI packet translation, **USB IDE ZIP drives drop mid-transfer or hang under probe-intensive tools**.

---

## 4. Diagnosis

The disk itself is fine if:
- It spins up audibly
- `hdparm -I /dev/sdX` returns valid data (uses ATA passthrough)
- Simple `dd` reads work: `sudo dd if=/dev/sdX bs=1M count=100 of=/dev/null`
- Partitions mount successfully

The issue is the adapter, not the disk.

---

## 5. Working Workarounds (Limited Success)

### Stop udisks2 (Helps but doesn't solve sustained operation failure)

```bash
# Stop background disk probing
sudo systemctl stop udisks2

# Perform recovery operations

# Restart when done
sudo systemctl start udisks2
```

This reduces interference but does NOT prevent the 12-minute timeout.

### For Short Operations (<10 minutes)

Simple `dd` works for small transfers:

```bash
# Works for first ~40GB only
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/path/to/output.img bs=1M status=progress conv=sync,noerror
```

Tested at 56-61 MB/s sustained read speed until timeout.

### For Full Disk Recovery: Chunked Reads with Cooling Breaks

```bash
# Read 10GB at a time with 30-60 second breaks
for i in {0..29}; do
  skip=$((i * 20480))  # Skip in MB
  echo "Reading chunk $i starting at ${skip}MB..."

  sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/data/fast/img/disk-chunk-${i}.img \
    bs=1M skip=$skip count=10240 conv=sync,noerror status=progress

  echo "Cooling break for 60 seconds..."
  sleep 60
done

# Reassemble later
cat disk-chunk-*.img > full-disk.img
```

### For Data Recovery: Direct Filesystem Access (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Bypass block-level imaging entirely
# Mount and copy files directly
for part in sdd{1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}; do
  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/recover
  sudo mount -o ro /dev/$part /mnt/recover
  sudo tar -czf /data/fast/recovery/${part}.tar.gz -C /mnt/recover .
  sudo umount /mnt/recover
done
```

This approach:
- Avoids sustained sequential reads that trigger the timeout
- Only reads actual file data, not empty space
- Natural breaks between files allow adapter to "recover"
- Much faster than full disk imaging

### For ddrescue (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**ddrescue fails with this adapter**, even with conservative settings like `-b 4096 -c 16`. The issue is that ddrescue does initial disk probing and geometry queries that trigger the adapter's SCSI translation bugs, causing USB resets and D-state hangs.

**Do NOT use ddrescue with this adapter.**

## 7. BIOS Configuration Guidelines

To ensure full compatibility and performance from the PEX2IDE, review these firmware settings.

| Setting | Recommended Value | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Option ROM Execution** | **Enabled** | Allows controller BIOS to enumerate (needed only for booting). |
| **CSM (Compatibility Support Module)** | **Enabled (Legacy Mode)** | Forces legacy I/O ranges 1F0/3F6 for classic drives. |
| **SATA/Storage Mode** | **IDE Compatibility** | Simplifies resource mapping for mixed controllers. |
| **IDE DMA** | **Auto/Enabled** | Enables UDMA up to the drive's capability. |
| **UDMA Mode** | **Mode 5 (ATA100)** or **Mode 6 (ATA133)** | Ensures max throughput. |
| **80-pin Cable Detection** | **Auto** | Verifies cable quality; required for UDMA > 2. |
| **PCIe ASPM (L1/L0s)** | **Disabled** | Prevents power-save link interruptions. |
| **Boot from PCI Storage** | **Disabled** | Avoids POST delays if drive isn't bootable. |

## 8. Linux Validation & Benchmark Checklist

After installation:

### Detect and Verify Driver

```bash
lspci -nnk | grep -A3 JMicron
dmesg | grep pata_jmicron
```

Expected:
```
pata_jmicron 0000:03:00.0: version 0.1.8
ata3: PATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x1f0 ctl 0x3f6 bmdma 0xcc00 irq 19
```

### Confirm DMA Mode

```bash
sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX | grep DMA
```

### SMART & Identify Tests

```bash
sudo hdparm -I /dev/sdX
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX
```

### ddrescue Trial Run

```bash
sudo ddrescue --idirect --force /dev/sdX test.img test.map
```

No "reset" or "medium removed" messages should appear in `dmesg`.

### Power & Timeout Stability

Monitor during long runs:

```bash
sudo dmesg -w
```

If you ever see `DMA timeout`, temporarily drop to PIO:

```bash
sudo hdparm -X0 /dev/sdX
```

## 9. Recommended Operating Baseline

| Layer | Setting |
|:--|:--|
| **BIOS** | Legacy/CSM ON, DMA Auto, UDMA 5–6, ASPM OFF |
| **Kernel Driver** | `pata_jmicron` (verify via `lspci`) |
| **I/O Tooling** | `ddrescue`, `hdparm`, `smartctl` — full access |
| **Power** | Dedicated Molex 12 V/5 V supply per drive |
| **Bus Topology** | One drive per cable (jumpered Master) |

## 11. Test Cases

### Failed Recovery Attempts with IS611

- **Attempt 1:** ddrescue with `--idirect` - hung within minutes
- **Attempt 2:** ddrescue with `-b 4096 -c 16` - failed at 4.8GB
- **Attempt 3:** Simple dd (udisks2 running) - failed at 42GB after 751 seconds
- **Attempt 4:** Simple dd (udisks2 stopped) - failed at 41GB after 739 seconds
- **Pattern:** Consistent 12-minute timeout across multiple disks and attempts

### Successful Workaround

- Mounted individual partitions and used tar to extract filesystem data
- Successfully recovered 300GB Seagate Barracuda 7200.8 (ST3300831A) with 11 ext3 partitions
- Avoided sustained sequential reads that trigger firmware timeout

---

## 12. Conclusion

Multiple **USB-to-IDE bridge chipsets** (including the Innostor IS611 and others) fail because they perform incomplete and incorrect SAT translation, corrupting SCSI CDBs and causing unpredictable resets. Additionally, many exhibit **time-based firmware failures** after approximately 12 minutes of sustained operation, making them unsuitable for full disk imaging.

The **widespread pattern of failures across different manufacturers and chipsets** suggests fundamental firmware quality problems in the USB-IDE bridge market. These are not isolated issues with specific products, but rather systemic problems with SCSI-to-ATA translation in USB bridge firmware.

Replacing USB bridges with the **StarTech PEX2IDE (JMicron JMB368)** provides a **true ATA interface** that supports full SMART/IDENTIFY operations, reliable error propagation, ddrescue compatibility, and **unlimited sustained operation** without time-based failures.

With the BIOS and driver configuration above, you'll have a stable, low-level recovery environment suitable for both **old IDE hard disks** and **ATAPI ZIP drives**, without the translation-layer bugs that plague USB-based controllers.

**Bottom line:** For serious IDE disk recovery work, avoid USB bridges entirely. Use a native PCIe IDE controller.
