# BUG-002: Copier SQL error - ambiguous mime_type column reference

**Filed:** 2025-10-10 12:50
**Filed by:** prox-claude
**Status:** fixed
**Fixed:** 2025-10-10 13:02
**Fixed by:** dev-claude
**Affected media:** ff9313ea (ff9313eae4e08e1e90add4b70190b5b9)
**Phase:** copying

---

## Observed Behavior

Copier successfully copies files to by-hash but fails to update database with SQL error.

**Commands run:**
```bash
sudo -E bin/ntt-copier.py --medium-hash ff9313eae4e08e1e90add4b70190b5b9 --worker-id test-worker --batch-size 50
```

**Output/Error:**
```
2025-10-10 12:49:50.533 | ERROR    | __main__:process_batch:966 - Batch processing error: column reference "mime_type" is ambiguous
LINE 3: ...          mime_type = COALESCE(updates.mime_type, mime_type)
                                                             ^
```

Full copier output shows files successfully created in by-hash:
```
2025-10-10 12:49:50.309 | INFO     | __main__:execute_copy_new_file_fs:1477 - Created by-hash file: /data/cold/by-hash/2b/8c/2b8c94f3d945595d85d91ea25772d56868b996e4b2e7ec69f532d4a3ead4c7c0
2025-10-10 12:49:50.315 | INFO     | __main__:execute_copy_new_file_fs:1477 - Created by-hash file: /data/cold/by-hash/33/87/3387544b03aa1dc40ffe9f1e2097def3a883c35471b109446e3a9dac55ee436c
...
(11 files total created successfully)
```

But then copier retries same batch because database update failed.

**Database state:**
```sql
-- Query run:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE copied = true) as copied,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE copied = false) as not_copied
FROM inode
WHERE medium_hash = 'ff9313eae4e08e1e90add4b70190b5b9';

-- Result:
 copied | not_copied
--------+------------
      2 |         11
```

Only 2 inodes marked copied (directories/NON_FILE), 11 files not marked despite being copied to filesystem.

**Filesystem state:**
```bash
# Commands run:
ls -lh /data/cold/by-hash/2b/8c/2b8c94f3d945595d85d91ea25772d56868b996e4b2e7ec69f532d4a3ead4c7c0

# Output:
-rwxr-x--- 2 root root 2.1K Dec 31  2001 /data/cold/by-hash/2b/8c/2b8c94f3d945595d85d91ea25772d56868b996e4b2e7ec69f532d4a3ead4c7c0
```

✓ File exists in by-hash - filesystem operations succeeded.

---

## Expected Behavior

Copier should complete database UPDATE after successful filesystem operations, marking all 11 inodes as `copied=true` and populating `blobid` column.

Per normal operation:
- Files copied to by-hash (✓ this happened)
- Hard links created in archived/ (✗ skipped due to transaction rollback)
- Database updated with `copied=true`, `blobid=<hash>` (✗ failed with SQL error)
- Copier exits cleanly (✗ retried endlessly)

---

## Success Condition

**How to verify fix (must be observable, reproducible, specific):**

1. Process a fresh medium through enumeration + loading
2. Run copier: `sudo -E bin/ntt-copier.py --medium-hash <hash> --worker-id test-worker --batch-size 50`
3. Check copier logs for successful completion (no SQL errors)
4. Verify database state shows all inodes copied
5. Verify files exist in both by-hash/ and archived/

**Fix is successful when:**
- [ ] Copier completes without "ambiguous" SQL errors in logs
- [ ] Query `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE copied = false) FROM inode WHERE medium_hash = '<hash>'` returns 0
- [ ] Query `SELECT COUNT(blobid) FROM path WHERE medium_hash = '<hash>'` matches number of files processed
- [ ] Test case: Process ff9313ea (640K floppy, 11 files) completes with "Worker test-worker finished: processed=11"
- [ ] All 11 files appear in `/data/cold/archived/mnt/ntt/ff9313ea.../` as hardlinks

---

## Impact

**Initial impact:** Blocks 1 medium (ff9313ea), likely affects all media processed after recent ntt-copier.py changes
**Workaround available:** no
**Severity:** High - copier cannot complete database transaction, leaves media in inconsistent state (files in by-hash but database not updated)

**Data inconsistency:**
- Files are in by-hash/ but `inode.copied=false`
- Re-running copier will retry endlessly (same SQL error)
- Cannot proceed to archiving phase

---

## Dev Notes

### Root Cause (2025-10-10 13:00)

The SQL error occurred in the batch UPDATE query at `ntt-copier.py:854-859`:

```sql
UPDATE inode SET copied = true, blobid = updates.blob_id,
                 mime_type = COALESCE(updates.mime_type, mime_type)
FROM unnest(%s::bigint[], %s::text[], %s::text[]) AS updates(id, blob_id, mime_type)
WHERE inode.id = updates.id
  AND inode.medium_hash = %s
```

The ambiguous column reference was on line 3: `COALESCE(updates.mime_type, mime_type)`.

PostgreSQL couldn't determine which `mime_type` to use as the fallback:
- `updates.mime_type` (from the unnest derived table)
- `inode.mime_type` (from the target table)

### Fix Applied (2025-10-10 13:02)

Changed line 855 in `ntt-copier.py` from:
```sql
mime_type = COALESCE(updates.mime_type, mime_type)
```

To:
```sql
mime_type = COALESCE(updates.mime_type, inode.mime_type)
```

This explicitly qualifies the fallback column with the table name, removing the ambiguity.

**Commit:** (pending - waiting for test verification)

## Severity Assessment (metrics-claude)

**Analysis date:** 2025-10-10 13:05

**Media affected:** 1 confirmed (ff9313ea)

**Pattern frequency:**
- Only occurrence in bug tracking system
- No similar SQL ambiguity errors in other bug reports
- First test run after code change that introduced the bug

**Workaround availability:** None (required code fix)

**Impact scope:**
- Blocked copier database updates completely
- Would affect 100% of media processed while bug existed
- However, caught immediately on first test run and fixed within 12 minutes
- Only 1 medium actually affected before fix deployed

**Severity: HIGH**

**Rationale:**
- No workaround available (required code modification)
- Completely blocked database transaction completion
- Would have affected all subsequent media if not caught immediately
- Database inconsistency risk (files in by-hash but not marked copied)
- Not marked as **BLOCKER** because:
  - Only 1 medium actually impacted
  - Fixed within 12 minutes of discovery
  - Did not block multiple media simultaneously
  - Does not prevent future processing (fix deployed)

**Resolution:**
- Fixed in `ntt-copier.py:855` by qualifying column name
- Verified by successful completion of ff9313ea after fix
- No recurrence expected (SQL is now unambiguous)

**Recommendations:**
- Consider SQL linting in development workflow
- Add test coverage for batch UPDATE queries
- Pattern suggests recent code changes should be tested on small media first
