# Production Success: Mount Helper Fixes Enable Processing of Previously Failed Media

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Validated by:** prox-claude
**Processed by:** ntt-orchestrator

---

## Summary

Three mount helper fixes (BUG-012, FEATURE-001, FEATURE-002) were tested and verified in production, enabling successful processing of 10 media that previously failed to mount or left orphaned loop devices.

**Production Results:**
- ✅ 10 media successfully processed through full pipeline (mount → enum → load → copy → archive)
- ✅ Zero orphaned loop devices remaining after processing
- ✅ Total: ~2.2GB processed → ~1.8GB archived to /data/cold/img-read/

---

## Fixes Deployed and Verified

### BUG-012: Orphaned Loop Device Cleanup ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED FIXED in production

**What was fixed:**
- Image path extraction in unmount logic was including extra fields (DIO, LOG-SEC)
- Changed from: `awk '{for(i=6;i<=NF;i++) printf "%s ", $i; print ""}'`
- Changed to: `awk '{print $6}'`
- Now correctly detaches ALL loop devices for an image, not just the mounted one

**Production verification:**
- Created test scenario with 4 loop devices for same image
- Unmount successfully detached all 4 devices
- Zero orphaned loop devices remained after processing 10 media
- No "(deleted)" loop devices accumulating in system

### FEATURE-001: APM Hybrid ISO/HFS+ Support ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED WORKING in production

**What was implemented:**
- Detect Apple Partition Map (APM) hybrid optical discs
- When PTTYPE=mac AND whole-disk TYPE=iso9660 or udf, mount whole disk instead of partitions
- Avoids trying to mount unmountable APM metadata partition

**Production verification:**
- **3 media successfully processed:**
  - 647bf9a84c34e4e2908037a87ceaa897 (900K) → 1.9KiB archived, 1 file
  - 9bfbfb9e7b86a330b4c45c1332e749e2 (353M) → 337MiB archived, 5141 files
  - d43eb00e96b4b2216e8e38a928d552be (341M) → 326MiB archived, 5206 files
- All three mounted successfully as ISO9660 (whole-disk mount)
- Full pipeline completed: mount → enum → load → copy → archive

**Example from logs:**
```
Multi-partition disk detected
  APM hybrid iso9660 disc detected - mounting whole disk
Mounted /dev/loop3 at /mnt/ntt/9bfbfb9e (APM hybrid, fs_type: iso9660)
```

### FEATURE-002: ext3 norecovery Support ✅

**Status:** VERIFIED WORKING (manual mount successful)

**What was implemented:**
- ext3 filesystems now use `norecovery` option instead of `noload`
- Enables mounting ext3 partitions with dirty journals (unclean shutdown)
- Filesystem stays read-only, no journal replay, preserves original state

**Verification:**
- Manual mount test successful on 5b64bb9ce6d6098040cfa94bb5188003 partition 1
- ext3 partition with dirty journal mounted successfully with `ro,norecovery`
- Filesystem readable (boot directory with kernel files visible)
- Kernel logs confirm: "mounted filesystem ro without journal"

**Production note:**
- Medium 5b64bb9ce6d6098040cfa94bb5188003 could not be processed by orchestrator
- Reason: Partition table truncation errors (incomplete ddrescue)
- Mount-helper fails silently when blkid can't detect filesystem types on truncated partitions
- Feature works correctly, but this specific medium needs manual intervention

## Impact Assessment

**Before fixes:**
- APM hybrid optical discs could not mount (mount-helper tried to mount unmountable APM metadata partition)
- ext3 with dirty journals failed to mount (noload option doesn't work for ext3)
- Loop devices accumulated after each orchestrator run (17 orphans observed on one medium)

**After fixes:**
- APM hybrid discs mount successfully (whole-disk ISO9660 layer)
- ext3 with dirty journals can mount with norecovery (verified manually)
- Loop devices properly cleaned up after unmount (zero orphans after processing 10 media)

**Unblocked media:**
- Minimum 3 APM hybrid optical discs now processable
- Unknown number of ext3 disks with dirty journals now processable
- All future media processing will properly clean up loop devices

---

## Testing Methodology

1. **Bug Identification:** Filed bugs during initial processing attempts
2. **Implementation:** dev-claude implemented fixes in bin/ntt-mount-helper
3. **Verification:** prox-claude tested each fix in isolation
4. **Production Validation:** Processed real media through full orchestrator pipeline
5. **Monitoring:** Verified zero orphaned loop devices, successful archives created

## Lessons Learned

### Mount Helper Edge Cases

**Issue:** Medium 5b64bb9ce6d6098040cfa94bb5188003 has truncated partition table
- Kernel detects partitions but marks them "beyond EOD"
- blkid cannot detect filesystem types on truncated partitions
- Mount-helper fails silently after "Multi-partition disk detected" message

**Potential Enhancement:**
- Mount-helper could fall back to mounting individual partitions even if blkid doesn't return TYPE
- Try auto-detection or explicit filesystem type probing for partitions

### Testing Workflow

**What worked well:**
- Testing each fix in isolation before production deployment
- Creating controlled test scenarios (e.g., 4 loop devices for BUG-012 test)
- Verifying with actual media rather than synthetic test cases

**Process:**
1. File bug with detailed diagnostics
2. Implement fix
3. Test in isolation
4. Move to bugs/fixed/
5. Validate in production with real media
